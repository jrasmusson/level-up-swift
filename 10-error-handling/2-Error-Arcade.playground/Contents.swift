🕹 Bad Bill - Error.

 Create an error called `BillError` and give it a single case called `negativeAmount`.

 */


/*
🕹 Bad Bill - throws.

 Write a method called payBill that takes an Double amount, and throws an `negativeAmount` error if the bill is a negative amount.
 If the bill is not negative simply print out the amount.
 Then call the method x3 ways - try, try?, try!.

 */




/*
🕹 Bad Bill - programmer error

 Take the payBill you just created, and re-write it to genereate a programmer error (assert() or preCondition())
 instead of throwing an error.

 Discussion: What are the differences between these two techniques? Which do you prefer? Why?
